## List of my awesome-LLM-* repositories (A TOC for my curations)
> I had ~400 tabs on my browser plus hundreds of link pages in my Oomnioutliner.
* _Too much confusion - can't find the answers ... by the time I find the answers, can't remember the question anymore !_
* So I decided to create a hierarcy and organization

> ***Note : Monikers like _Defender Dossier_ and _Metric Minds_ were suggested by ChatGPT. So don't blame me. Mr.Altman is the culprit !***
